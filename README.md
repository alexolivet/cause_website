Synopsis

Group project. I worked on the CSS part mostly. Framework is fully responsive. Menu slides smoothly on screen side changes. Main goal was to have a fully responsive website with a donate page ( and js widget ).

Motivation

This is an assignment done while taking classes at the New York Code and Design Academy in The Netherlands. This was a great assignment to do as we learned a lot about GIT entries and working on similar project with a group (3people).
